# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities**: refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

This command is _informed_ by the project's domain model and built on a shared design vocabulary — **inlined here, so the skill works on a bare host**: **module**, **interface**, **depth**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**, **locality**; the deletion test ("would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it?"); "the interface is the test surface"; "one adapter = hypothetical seam, two = real". Use these terms exactly in every suggestion, and don't drift into "component", "service", "API" or "boundary". If your host also ships a `codebase-design` skill, invoke it for the full method — this inlined set is the floor, not the ceiling.

The domain language in `GLOSSARY.md` gives names to good seams; ADRs in `docs/adr/` record decisions this command should not re-litigate. Neither file exists here: the grilling loop creates `GLOSSARY.md` lazily, and a setwave epic's `## ADR stub` sections are the ADR record of record.

## Process

### 1. Explore

**Scope before you scan: YAGNI.** Deepening a module pays off by making future changes to it easier, so put extra weight on the parts of the codebase that have recently changed. Decide *where* to look before you look:

- If the user named a direction (a module, a subsystem, a pain point), take it, and skip the inference below.
- Otherwise, walk back a good stretch of the commit history (`git log --oneline`) to find the codebase's hot spots, the files and areas that keep coming up, and let those paths pull your attention first. If the changes are scattered with no clear hot spot, widen the net.

Read the project's domain glossary (`GLOSSARY.md`) and any ADRs in the area you're touching first.

Then spawn a sub-agent to walk the codebase. Don't follow rigid heuristics; explore organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow**, with an interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow: would deleting it concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want.

### 2. Present candidates as an HTML report

Write a self-contained HTML file to the OS temp directory so nothing lands in the repo. Resolve the temp dir from `$TMPDIR`, falling back to `/tmp` (or `%TEMP%` on Windows), and write to `<tmpdir>/architecture-review-<timestamp>.html` so each run gets a fresh file. Open it for the user (`open <path>` on macOS, `xdg-open <path>` on Linux, `start <path>` on Windows) and tell them the absolute path.

The report uses **Tailwind via CDN** for layout and styling, and **Mermaid via CDN** for diagrams where a graph/flow/sequence reliably communicates the structure. Mix Mermaid with hand-crafted CSS/SVG visuals: use Mermaid when relationships are graph-shaped (call graphs, dependencies, sequences), and hand-built divs/SVG when you want something more editorial (mass diagrams, cross-sections, collapse animations). Each candidate gets a **before/after visualisation**. Be visual. The full scaffold, diagram patterns and styling rules live in [HTML-REPORT.md](HTML-REPORT.md) — read it before writing the report, never paraphrase from memory.

For each candidate, render a card with:

- **Files**: which files/modules are involved
- **Problem**: why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution**: plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits**: explained in terms of locality and leverage, and how tests would improve
- **Before / After diagram**: side-by-side, custom-drawn, illustrating the shallowness and the deepening
- **Recommendation strength**: one of `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, `Speculative`, rendered as a badge

End the report with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate you'd tackle first and why.

**Use GLOSSARY.md vocabulary for the domain, and the inlined architecture vocabulary for the structure.** If `GLOSSARY.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module," not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR (or a setwave epic's `## ADR stub`), only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting. Mark it clearly in the card and don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the file is written, ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, run the grilling loop **the same way `setwave:define` runs its rounds**: decisions form a tree, ask the whole current frontier in one round, every question numbered and carrying your recommended answer, and recompute the frontier after each answer. Facts of the environment go to a read-only subagent, not to the owner. Walk the picked candidate through: constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `GLOSSARY.md`?** Add the term to `GLOSSARY.md`. Create the file lazily if it doesn't exist.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `GLOSSARY.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer; skip ephemeral reasons and self-evident ones.
- **The candidate should become work?** Author it the setwave way: bodies to a plan directory, linted with the same rules `wave lint` runs, and `wave plan` as the only door to GitHub — the same flow `setwave:define` uses.
